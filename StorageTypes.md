# Storage Types

Use different storages as outputs for different purposes.

Primary outputs of a machine are connected to Primary Storage, secondary outputs are connected to secondary storage.

Machines can have any combination of Primary and secondary outputs.

When a machine only has secondary outputs, it will always run and potentially void all outputs.

When you have 2 secondary outputs, it's sometimes better to have 2 same machines with each machine having one output as primary.


# Primary Storage

- don't take any more items/fluid, when limit reached
- are connected to ME as high prio storage (insert and extract)
- drawers for items
- drums for fluids

# Secondary Storage

- always will take items/fluids; void excess
- are connected to ME as low prio storage (extract only)
- drawers with voiding upgrades for items
- drum + trashcan for fluids
- when inserting, use secondary channel
